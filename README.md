## Instructions
This is a simple pong variant where the objective is not to hit the ball with your paddle, but to avoid it.
If the ball hits your paddle, your opponent will score and your paddle will be sped up to improve your ability
to avoid the ball in the future.
This is played hotseat with two players.

## Controls
**Player 1:**
- Up: W
- Down: S

**Player 2:**
- Up: Up Arrow
- Down: Down Arrow

**Menus:**
- Up: W or Up Arrow
- Down: S or Down Arrow
- Select: Enter or Space

## Purpose
This was intended as a learning project with the goal of developing a simple, well-documented game in C++ 
with the Raylib framework. Some aspects of the program are over-engineered for the sake of implementing extensible
systems for the hell of it, while other aspects are simplified for readability and quick implementation (i.e. the 
*hopefully* responsible use of raw pointers throughout).
